# Chat Room

This project is just a simple chatroom that I built to learn a few new technologies: Express, Node.js, socket.io, and jade. Nothing fancy due to some time management problems. Not even usernames are given so everyone is annonymous. Not even styled because I didn't feel like it would contribute to learning the new technologies.

## How It Works

The main technology that allows the chatroom to work is Socket.io. When the server receives new information, a certain task is performed depending on what the creator wants. In this case, when I receive the new information, I send it to everyone and add it into the chatroom. 

## How To Contribute

None needed. This project allowed me to learn the basics of a few new techonologies. I might continue working on this to further my knowledge in these technologies so I don't need contributions.

## How To Clone

Everything in master is updated. So you can clone it if you want with the code.

## Resources

Here are a few resources I used.

1. Treehouse has amazing tutorials on node.js and express where I learned the basics.
2. This tutorial about making a chatroom has very good explainations for each line of code, but I didn't like the way this chat room was built: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/real-time-chat-with-nodejs-socketio-and-expressjs--net-31708
3. The one that I thought was very helpful was this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKNYLv2BpQ.

And each technology had their own documentations website that I used as well. The jade website had a translator where I practiced writing in jade and it turned it to html for me to see. Some documentations were helpful, others weren't that great.
