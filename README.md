# Chat Room

This project is just a simple chatroom that I built to learn a few new technologies: Express, Node.js, socket.io, and jade. Nothing fancy due to some time management problems. Not even usernames are given so everyone is annonymous. Not even styled because I didn't feel like it would contribute to learning the new technologies.

## How It Works

The main technology that allows the chatroom to work is Socket.io. When the server receives new information, a certain task is performed depending on what the creator wants. In this case, when I receive the new information, I send it to everyone and add it into the chatroom. 

## How To Contribute

None needed. This project allowed me to learn the basics of a few new techonologies. I might continue working on this to further my knowledge in these technologies so I don't need contributions.

## How To Clone

Everything in master is updated. So you can clone it if you want with the code.
